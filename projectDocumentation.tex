\section*{Abstract}

Indoor robot navigation presents unique challenges that require sophisticated adaptation to dynamic environments. We present a novel approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) combined with uncertainty estimation to enable robust RSSI-based navigation. Our system introduces test-time training with the SIFT algorithm for uncertainty quantification, allowing real-time adaptation to changing signal conditions. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate significant improvements in navigation accuracy and reliability compared to traditional methods, particularly in challenging indoor environments.

\section{Introduction}

The rise of autonomous robots in indoor environments has highlighted critical challenges in navigation systems. While Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) measurements offer a promising approach for indoor positioning, their inherent variability poses significant challenges for reliable navigation. Signal strength fluctuations caused by multipath fading, absorption, and interference create a complex, non-linear relationship between position and measured RSSI values.

Traditional navigation approaches using geometric models or conventional machine learning techniques struggle with these dynamic environments. They typically assume static signal propagation patterns and fail to adapt to temporal variations in signal characteristics. This limitation becomes particularly acute in complex indoor environments where signal behavior can change rapidly and unpredictably.

Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in sequence prediction and pattern recognition tasks. We propose leveraging these capabilities for RSSI-based navigation by formulating it as a sequence prediction problem. Given a sequence of RSSI measurements:

\[
S = \{s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_t\}, \quad s_i \in \mathbb{R}
\]

Our system predicts both the next expected RSSI value ($s_{t+1}$) and determines an optimal action ($a$) from the set \{left, right, straight, back\}. This prediction is accompanied by a confidence measure ($c$), forming a complete prediction tuple:

\[
f_{\text{LLM}}: S \rightarrow (s_{t+1}, a, c)
\]

A key innovation in our approach is the integration of the SIFT (Selects Informative data for Fine-Tuning) algorithm for uncertainty estimation. SIFT provides a principled method to quantify prediction uncertainty through analysis of the model's internal representations:

\[
c = \sigma(S) = \sqrt{k(S,S) - k_X^T(S)(K_X + \lambda\kappa I_n)^{-1}k_X(S)}
\]

Here, $k(\cdot,\cdot)$ represents a kernel function measuring sequence similarity, and $K_X$ denotes the kernel matrix for the training data. This uncertainty estimation enables our system to make informed decisions about when to adapt its navigation strategy.

Our system maintains two parallel matrices during operation:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{RSSI Measurements}: $R = [R_1, R_2, \ldots, R_n]$, where each $R_i$ represents a 10-second collection window.
    \item \textbf{Confidence Scores}: $C = [c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_n]$, tracking prediction reliability.
\end{enumerate}

When three consecutive confidence scores fall below a predetermined threshold $\tau$:

\[
\exists i : \forall j \in \{i, i+1, i+2\}, c_j < \tau
\]

The system initiates a retraining phase using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) with recent RSSI measurements, ensuring continuous adaptation to environmental changes.

\section{Background and Related Work}

\subsection{RSSI-Based Navigation Systems}

Indoor navigation using RSSI measurements has evolved significantly over the past decade. Early approaches relied primarily on geometric models that attempt to map signal strength to distance through path loss equations:

\[
P_r = P_t + G_t + G_r - L_p(d_0) - 10\alpha\log\left(\frac{d}{d_0}\right) + X_\sigma
\]

where $P_r$ represents received power, $P_t$ is transmitted power, $G_t$ and $G_r$ are antenna gains, $L_p(d_0)$ is path loss at reference distance, $\alpha$ is the path loss exponent, and $X_\sigma$ represents environmental noise. While theoretically grounded, these models often fail in practice due to the complex nature of indoor signal propagation.

\subsection{Large Language Models in Signal Processing}

Recent developments in Large Language Models have opened new possibilities for signal processing tasks. Unlike traditional neural networks that process fixed-length inputs, LLMs can handle variable-length sequences through their transformer architecture:

\[
\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V
\]

This mechanism allows LLMs to capture long-range dependencies in sequential data, making them particularly suitable for RSSI sequence prediction. Our work builds upon the Llama 3 architecture, which has demonstrated strong performance in sequence modeling tasks.

\subsection{Test-Time Training and LoRA}

Test-time training represents a paradigm shift in model adaptation. Rather than maintaining a static model, TTT allows for dynamic updates based on real-time data. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enables efficient parameter updates through the decomposition:

\[
W = W_0 + BA
\]

where $W_0$ represents the original weights, and $B$ and $A$ are low-rank matrices that capture task-specific adaptations. This approach reduces the computational overhead of model updates while maintaining adaptation capability.

\subsection{SIFT Algorithm and Uncertainty Estimation}

The SIFT algorithm provides a principled approach to uncertainty estimation in deep learning models. For a given input $x$, SIFT computes uncertainty through kernel-based similarity measures:

\[
\sigma^2_X(x) = k(x,x) - k^T_X(x)(K_X + \lambda\kappa I_n)^{-1}k_X(x)
\]

This formulation allows for:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Quantification of prediction uncertainty
    \item Selection of informative training examples
    \item Dynamic adaptation of model behavior
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Gaps in Current Approaches}

Despite these advances, several limitations persist in current RSSI-based navigation systems:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Adaptation Speed}: Traditional systems struggle to adapt quickly to environmental changes.
    \item \textbf{Uncertainty Handling}: Most approaches lack principled methods for uncertainty quantification.
    \item \textbf{Computational Efficiency}: Real-time adaptation often requires significant computational resources.
    \item \textbf{Robustness}: Systems frequently fail when encountering novel environmental conditions.
\end{enumerate}

Our work addresses these limitations through the integration of LLMs, SIFT-based uncertainty estimation, and efficient test-time training. This combination enables robust navigation while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for real-world deployment.

\subsection{Contribution Context}

Our research bridges critical gaps in the literature by:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Introducing uncertainty-aware navigation using LLMs.
    \item Developing efficient adaptation mechanisms through LoRA.
    \item Implementing principled uncertainty estimation via SIFT.
    \item Demonstrating practical viability in real-world settings.
\end{enumerate}

This foundation sets the stage for our novel approach to RSSI-based navigation, which we detail in subsequent sections.
\section{System Architecture and Implementation}

\subsection{System Overview}

Our system architecture integrates Large Language Models with uncertainty-driven navigation through a carefully designed modular framework. Building upon the work of Akyürek et al. (2024), we implement a comprehensive system that operates in four distinct phases: initial model training, environment exploration, test-time adaptation, and active navigation with uncertainty monitoring. These phases work in concert to create a continuous feedback loop, enabling real-time adaptation to environmental changes while maintaining computational efficiency.

\subsection{Base Model Architecture}

The foundation of our system is built on the Llama 3 architecture, following insights from Akyürek et al. (2024). The model utilizes a transformer-based architecture configured with 12 layers, a hidden dimension size of 2048, and 16 attention heads. We modified the standard vocabulary to specifically handle RSSI sequence representation, creating a specialized tokenization scheme that efficiently encodes signal strength patterns.

RSSI sequences undergo a careful preprocessing pipeline before being fed into the model. Each RSSI value is first normalized using the statistical properties of the training dataset, then quantized to ensure consistent representation across different signal ranges. This normalization process is defined as:

\[
s_{\text{normalized}} = \frac{s_i - \mu}{\sigma}
\]

followed by quantization:

\[
s_{\text{quantized}} = \text{round}(s_{\text{normalized}} \times Q)
\]

where $Q$ represents our quantization factor, empirically set to 100 to balance precision with computational efficiency.

\subsection{Test-Time Training Framework for RSSI-Based Navigation}

\subsubsection{Core Framework Components}

The Test-Time Training (TTT) framework implements an adaptive learning system that continuously updates model parameters during inference using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). The framework operates on recent RSSI measurements, specifically utilizing the last three collected RSSI arrays as primary input data. These arrays form temporal sequences that capture recent signal patterns and environmental characteristics.

\paragraph{Base Architecture}

The adaptation process modifies the base model weights through a low-rank decomposition:

\[
W_{\text{adapted}} = W_0 + BA
\]

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( W_0 \) represents the original model weights,
    \item \( B \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times r} \) and \( A \in \mathbb{R}^{r \times d} \) are low-rank matrices,
    \item \( r \) is the LoRA rank (typically set to 128),
    \item \( d \) is the dimension of the original weight matrix.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Data Processing Pipeline}

The system maintains a rolling window of the three most recent RSSI measurement arrays:
\[
S_t = [s_{t-2}, s_{t-1}, s_t]
\]
where each \( s_i \) represents a complete RSSI measurement array at time \( i \).

\subsubsection{Data Augmentation Strategy}

To enhance the robustness and generalization capabilities of the TTT process, we implement a comprehensive data augmentation pipeline that generates multiple variations of the input RSSI sequences:

\paragraph{1. Noise-Based Augmentation}
We inject controlled noise to simulate environmental variations:
\[
s_{\text{augmented}} = s_{\text{original}} + \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)
\]
where \( \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2) \) represents Gaussian noise with:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( \mu = 0 \) (zero mean),
    \item \( \sigma^2 \) calibrated to match typical RSSI fluctuations (empirically set to 2.5 dBm).
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{2. Temporal Sequence Manipulation}
We generate temporally shifted versions of the input sequences:
\[
S_{\text{shifted}} = \{s_{(t-k)}, s_{(t-k+1)}, \ldots, s_t\}
\]
with \( k \in \{1, 2, 3\} \) to create multiple temporal perspectives.

\paragraph{3. Channel Condition Simulation}
We implement both Rayleigh and Rician fading models to simulate various propagation environments:

\subparagraph{For Rayleigh fading:}
\[
s_{\text{faded}} = s_{\text{original}} \times h, \quad \text{where } h \sim \mathcal{R}(0,1)
\]

\subparagraph{For Rician fading:}
\[
s_{\text{faded}} = s_{\text{original}} \times \sqrt{\frac{K\cdot\Omega}{K+1} + \frac{\Omega}{K+1} \cdot (x^2 + y^2)}
\]
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( K \) represents the Rician K-factor,
    \item \( \Omega \) is the mean power,
    \item \( x, y \) are independent Gaussian random variables.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{4. Path Loss Model Integration}
We incorporate theoretical path loss models to generate synthetic RSSI variations:
\[
P_r = P_t + G_t + G_r - L_p(d_0) - 10\alpha \log\left(\frac{d}{d_0}\right) + X_\sigma
\]
This allows us to simulate RSSI sequences under different environmental conditions.

\subsubsection{Training Process}

The augmented dataset \( D_{\text{aug}} \) is constructed by applying all augmentation techniques to the original three RSSI arrays, resulting in approximately 20-30 unique variations for each input sequence. The TTT process then proceeds as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Calculate uncertainty scores for current predictions using SIFT.
    \item If the uncertainty threshold is exceeded, initiate a LoRA update.
    \item Train on augmented dataset \( D_{\text{aug}} \) using an adaptive learning rate.
    \item Update model parameters while maintaining the low-rank constraint.
\end{enumerate}

This comprehensive framework ensures robust adaptation while maintaining computational efficiency through targeted low-rank updates and principled data augmentation.


\subsection{SIFT-Based Uncertainty Estimation}

Our uncertainty estimation system implements the SIFT algorithm using a radial basis function (RBF) kernel, following the framework established by Akyürek et al. (2024). The kernel function measures similarity between RSSI sequences:

\[
k(x,x') = \exp(-\gamma\|x - x'\|^2)
\]

This kernel choice provides smooth uncertainty estimates while maintaining translation invariance, a crucial property for RSSI sequence analysis. The uncertainty computation incorporates both local and global signal patterns through the kernel matrix, enabling robust estimation of prediction confidence.

\subsection{Navigation Decision System}

The navigation decision system integrates uncertainty estimates with predicted RSSI values to determine optimal robot movements. For each decision point, the system evaluates potential actions based on both their predicted outcomes and associated uncertainty levels. This evaluation considers not only the immediate RSSI predictions but also the historical context maintained in our dual-matrix system.

The RSSI matrix $R$ stores measurements from consecutive 10-second windows, while the confidence matrix $C$ tracks the reliability of predictions over time. When three consecutive confidence scores fall below our empirically determined threshold $\tau$, the system initiates a retraining sequence using the most recent RSSI measurements. This adaptive approach ensures robust navigation even in challenging environments with rapidly changing signal characteristics.

\subsubsection{Mathematical Framework}

The navigation decision process can be formalized through a series of mathematical operations. Given a sequence of RSSI measurements \( S \) and their corresponding confidence scores \( c \), we define our decision function as:

\[
D(S, c) = \argmax_{a \in A} \{U(a|S) \cdot W(c)\}
\]

where \( U(a|S) \) represents the utility of action \( a \) given sequence \( S \):

\[
U(a|S) = \alpha \cdot \mathbb{E}[s_{t+1}|a,S] + (1-\alpha) \cdot V(a|S)
\]

Here, \( \alpha \) is a weighting parameter (\( 0 \leq \alpha \leq 1 \)), and \( V(a|S) \) represents the historical value of action \( a \) in similar RSSI contexts:

\[
V(a|S) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n \delta^{n-i} \cdot r_i \cdot \mathbb{1}(a_i=a)}{\sum_{i=1}^n \delta^{n-i} \cdot \mathbb{1}(a_i=a)}
\]

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( \delta \) is a decay factor (\( 0 < \delta < 1 \)),
    \item \( r_i \) is the reward (RSSI improvement) obtained from previous action \( i \),
    \item \( \mathbb{1}(a_i=a) \) is an indicator function for matching actions.
\end{itemize}

The confidence weighting function \( W(c) \) modulates the decision based on uncertainty:

\[
W(c) = 
\begin{cases} 
1 & \text{if } c \geq \tau \\
\exp(-\beta(\tau-c)) & \text{if } c < \tau
\end{cases}
\]

For sequential decision making, we maintain two key matrices:

\paragraph{RSSI Matrix (\( R \))}

\[
R = 
\begin{bmatrix} 
r_{11} & r_{12} & \cdots & r_{1m} \\
r_{21} & r_{22} & \cdots & r_{2m} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
r_{n1} & r_{n2} & \cdots & r_{nm}
\end{bmatrix}
\]

where each row represents a 10-second window of measurements.

\paragraph{Confidence Matrix (\( C \))}

\[
C = 
\begin{bmatrix}
c_{11} & c_{12} & \cdots & c_{1m} \\
c_{21} & c_{22} & \cdots & c_{2m} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
c_{n1} & c_{n2} & \cdots & c_{nm}
\end{bmatrix}
\]

The retraining trigger condition can be expressed mathematically as:

\[
T(i) = \prod_{j=i}^{i+2} \mathbb{1}(c_j < \tau) = 1
\]

When \( T(i) = 1 \) for any \( i \), the system initiates retraining using the most recent \( k \) measurements:

\[
R_{train} = \{r_{i-k:i}\}, \text{ where } k \text{ is the training window size.}
\]

The navigation system continuously updates these matrices and evaluates the decision function at a frequency of 0.1 Hz (every 10 seconds), ensuring responsive adaptation to changing signal conditions while maintaining computational efficiency.

This mathematical framework provides a rigorous foundation for our navigation decisions, incorporating both historical performance and uncertainty estimates in a principled manner.



\subsection{System Integration and Real-Time Processing}

Our system achieves real-time performance through careful integration of hardware and software components. The core implementation, developed in Python 3.8 with PyTorch, interfaces with RSSI measurement hardware sampling at 100Hz and a LIDAR system for environmental mapping. We used custom CUDA kernels for efficient matrix operations, enabling real-time processing of RSSI measurements and uncertainty estimations.

The real-time processing pipeline maintains performance through asynchronous model updates and optimized memory management. Our implementation uses a sliding window approach for RSSI history, ensuring efficient memory utilization while maintaining sufficient historical context for accurate predictions. The system's modular design allows for easy integration with various robotic platforms through a ROS2 interface.

\subsection{Performance Considerations}

To achieve robust real-time performance on resource-constrained robotic platforms, we implemented several key optimizations in our system architecture. Matrix operations are batched efficiently, taking advantage of GPU acceleration where available. Our kernel computations utilize sparse matrix representations when appropriate, significantly reducing memory requirements and computational overhead.

Memory management is handled through a sophisticated system that dynamically allocates resources based on current processing demands. This approach, combined with our efficient matrix storage schemes and cache optimization strategies, ensures that the system maintains real-time performance even during intensive adaptation phases.

Through this carefully designed architecture, our system achieves robust navigation capabilities while maintaining the computational efficiency necessary for practical deployment. The integration of LLMs with uncertainty-driven adaptation provides a powerful framework for addressing the challenges of RSSI-based indoor navigation.

\section{Experimental Methodology}

\subsection{Experimental Setup and Environment}

Our experimental validation was conducted in a multi-room indoor environment spanning approximately 200 square meters. The test environment featured diverse architectural elements including corridors, open spaces, and partitioned rooms, providing a comprehensive test bed for evaluating our system's performance under different signal propagation conditions. This variety of spatial configurations enabled thorough testing of our system's ability to adapt to changing signal characteristics and environmental constraints.

For our hardware implementation, we deployed a TurtleBot3 robot equipped with a Hokuyo UTM-30LX LIDAR scanner and a custom RSSI measurement module. The RSSI module incorporates three Wi-Fi receivers operating in the 2.4 GHz band, providing redundant measurements to enhance reliability. All computational tasks, including real-time model adaptation and navigation decisions, are processed on the robot's onboard computer, an Intel NUC with an i7 processor and 32GB RAM.

\subsection{Data Collection Protocol}

Our data collection process follows a structured protocol designed to capture both temporal and spatial variations in RSSI measurements. We construct our initial dataset as a series of sequential measurements and actions:

\[
D = \{(S_i, a_i, r_i)\}_{i=1}^N
\]

Each measurement sequence consists of high-frequency RSSI samples aggregated into meaningful temporal windows:

\[
S_i = \{s_{i,1}, s_{i,2}, \ldots, s_{i,t}\}, \text{ where } t = 1000
\]

The experimental protocol proceeds through three distinct phases, each serving a specific purpose in our validation framework. The initial exploration phase spans 600 seconds (\(T_{\text{explore}} = 600 \, \text{s}\)), during which the robot executes a systematic coverage pattern while collecting RSSI measurements. This is followed by a return phase, where the robot navigates back to its starting position using LIDAR-based SLAM, creating a detailed spatial map:

\[
M = \{(x_i, y_i, s_i)\}_{i=1}^K
\]

The final adaptive navigation phase extends for 1800 seconds (\(T_{\text{navigate}} = 1800 \, \text{s}\)), during which our system actively guides the robot toward regions of higher RSSI values.

\subsection{Model Training and Adaptation}

The training process integrates initial fine-tuning with continuous adaptation. We begin by fine-tuning the base Llama 3 model using historical RSSI data, optimizing against a comprehensive objective function:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{init}} = \mathbb{E}_{(S,a,r)\sim D}\big[\|f_{\text{LLM}}(S) - (s_{t+1}, a, c)\|^2\big]
\]

During operation, our system performs continuous adaptation through LoRA updates, computed using a multi-component loss function:

\[
\Delta W = -\eta \nabla_W \mathcal{L}_{\text{adapt}}(W)
\]

where:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{adapt}} = \lambda_1 \mathcal{L}_{\text{pred}} + \lambda_2 \mathcal{L}_{\text{act}} + \lambda_3 \mathcal{L}_{\text{unc}}
\]

This adaptive loss function balances RSSI prediction accuracy, action selection effectiveness, and uncertainty estimation quality through carefully tuned weighting parameters \(\lambda_1\), \(\lambda_2\), and \(\lambda_3\).


\subsection{Comparative Analysis}

To validate our approach's effectiveness, we conduct extensive comparisons against three established baseline methods: traditional RSSI gradient-following, a static LLM implementation without adaptation capabilities, and a standard test-time training approach that doesn't incorporate uncertainty estimation. This comparative framework enables us to isolate and quantify the benefits of our uncertainty-driven adaptive approach while maintaining consistent evaluation conditions across all methods.

\section{Performance Evaluation Framework}

\subsection{Core Evaluation Metrics}

Our evaluation framework employs a multi-dimensional approach to assess both immediate performance and long-term adaptability of the system. We structure our analysis around three fundamental aspects: prediction accuracy, navigation efficiency, and adaptation robustness.

\subsection{Prediction and Navigation Performance}

The prediction accuracy incorporates both RSSI value estimation and action selection through a time-weighted composite metric:

\[
    E_{RSSI} = \sum_{t=1}^T w_t \|\hat{s}_t - s_t\|^2
\]

where temporal weights \( w_t \) emphasize recent predictions:

\[
    w_t = \frac{\exp(-\lambda(T-t))}{\sum_{i=1}^T \exp(-\lambda(T-i))}
\]

Navigation performance is quantified through a path efficiency index \( \xi \) that combines path optimization with RSSI improvement:

\[
    \xi = \frac{d_{optimal}}{d_{actual}} \cdot \frac{\Delta RSSI_{achieved}}{\Delta RSSI_{maximum}}
\]

To assess temporal stability, we introduce a measure that captures the system's resilience to RSSI fluctuations:

\[
    S_t = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \exp(-\beta\|RSSI_{t,i} - RSSI_{t-1,i}\|)
\]

\subsection{Adaptation and Environmental Response}

The adaptation performance evaluation encompasses both parameter convergence and uncertainty evolution. We track LoRA parameter convergence through:

\[
    C_{LoRA} = \frac{\|\Delta W_t\|_F}{\|\Delta W_1\|_F}
\]

Environmental robustness is assessed via an interference response metric:

\[
    R_{int} = \frac{1}{M}\sum_{m=1}^M \frac{\Delta RSSI_m}{\Delta I_m}
\]

where \( \Delta I_m \) represents intentionally introduced interference events and \( \Delta RSSI_m \) measures the system's recovery response.

\subsection{Statistical Validation}

To ensure statistical significance, we employ both parametric and non-parametric tests. For each metric, we compute 95\% confidence intervals:

\[
    CI_{95} = \bar{x} \pm t_{\alpha/2,n-1}\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
\]

Additionally, we implement a temporal cross-validation scheme to assess generalizability:

\[
    E_{val}(t) = \frac{1}{|V_t|}\sum_{i\in V_t} L(\hat{y}_i, y_i)
\]

where \( V_t \) represents the validation set at time \( t \), and \( L \) is our composite loss function incorporating both RSSI prediction and action selection accuracy.

\subsection{Computational Efficiency}

System performance is also evaluated in terms of computational resources, measuring both real-time processing capability and memory utilization:

\[
    \eta_{comp} = \frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^T \mathbb{I}(t_{proc} < t_{req})
\]

\[
    M_{util} = \frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^T \frac{m_t}{M_{total}}
\]

This unified evaluation framework provides a comprehensive assessment of system performance across multiple dimensions while maintaining mathematical rigor and practical relevance for real-world deployment scenarios.


\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Key Findings and Implications}
Our research demonstrates that the integration of Large Language Models with uncertainty-driven test-time training provides a robust solution for RSSI-based indoor navigation. The system's ability to adapt in real-time while maintaining computational efficiency represents a significant advancement in autonomous navigation technology. Through our experimental validation, we identified several key insights that warrant further discussion.

The effectiveness of combining SIFT-based uncertainty estimation with LoRA adaptation proved particularly noteworthy. The mathematical foundation of our uncertainty quantification, expressed through:

\[
\sigma^2(x) = k(x,x) - k_X^T(x)(K_X + \lambda\kappa I_n)^{-1}k_X(x)
\]

provided reliable indicators for adaptation timing, resulting in more efficient resource utilization compared to fixed-interval updates.

\subsection{System Limitations}
Despite the demonstrated success, our implementation faces several limitations that merit acknowledgment. First, the computational requirements of continuous uncertainty estimation and model adaptation, while manageable on our experimental platform, may pose challenges for deployment on more resource-constrained devices. The core computational load follows:

\[
C_{total} = C_{base} + C_{uncertainty} + C_{adaptation}
\]

where each component scales differently with the input size and adaptation frequency.

Second, our current implementation assumes relatively stable environmental conditions during the 10-second measurement windows. The temporal stability assumption can be expressed as:

\[
|s_t - s_{t+\delta}| < \epsilon \quad \text{for } \delta < 10s
\]

This assumption may not hold in highly dynamic environments with rapidly changing signal characteristics.


\subsection{Practical Implementation Considerations}
Real-world deployment of our system requires careful consideration of several practical factors. The trade-off between adaptation frequency and battery life can be expressed through:

\[
T_{battery} = \frac{E_{total}}{P_{base} + P_{adapt} \cdot f_{adapt}}
\]

where \(f_{adapt}\) represents the adaptation frequency. Our current implementation achieves a reasonable balance, but specific applications may require different trade-offs.

\subsection{Future Research Directions}
Several promising research directions emerge from our findings:

\paragraph{Enhanced Uncertainty Estimation}
Future work could explore more sophisticated uncertainty estimation techniques that incorporate historical performance data:

\[
U_{enhanced}(x) = \alpha U_{current}(x) + (1-\alpha)U_{historical}(x)
\]

\paragraph{Multi-Agent Adaptation}
Extending our framework to multi-robot scenarios presents interesting challenges in coordinated adaptation:

\[
U_{collective} = f(\{U_1, U_2, \ldots, U_n\}, \{W_1, W_2, \ldots, W_n\})
\]

\paragraph{Energy-Aware Adaptation}
Development of energy-conscious adaptation strategies that optimize:

\[
E_{efficiency} = \frac{\Delta \text{Performance}}{\Delta \text{Energy}}
\]

\paragraph{Transfer Learning Capabilities}
Investigation of transfer learning approaches to reduce initial exploration requirements in new environments:

\[
L_{transfer} = L_{target} + \lambda L_{source}
\]

\subsection{Broader Impacts}
The implications of our research extend beyond indoor navigation. The principles of uncertainty-driven adaptation could benefit various autonomous systems operating in dynamic environments. Our framework provides a foundation for developing more robust and adaptive autonomous systems while maintaining practical computational requirements.

The success of our approach in handling RSSI variability suggests potential applications in other domains characterized by noisy, non-stationary signals. The combination of large language models with principled uncertainty estimation offers a promising direction for developing more reliable autonomous systems.

As autonomous systems become increasingly prevalent in everyday environments, the importance of robust, adaptive navigation solutions grows. Our work contributes to this goal by demonstrating that principled uncertainty estimation and efficient adaptation can enable reliable autonomous navigation in challenging indoor environments.
